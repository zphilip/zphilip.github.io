    By introduce extra Machine learning based abnormal detect to trigger the hold procedure in time so that the system
    could much more better holdover performance, at same time alarm the customer that the sync input reference is
    invalid and holdover happens.
2. Detection and prevention of DDOS with AIML for BTS
    Detecting the pre-deﬁﬁned Intrusion attack to BTS (DDOS only in phase1) based on AI/ML solution (ready AI/ML
    solution from Bell Lab) so that BTS could take pre-deﬁﬁned actions to prevent BTS service down while Intrusion is
    ongoing and recovery BTS service in time while Intrusion is end.
3. A Machine learning based Transport admission control for BTS 
    This project study a new machine learning method: GPR or Sparse GPR based TAC. The GPR based TAC has ability to
    learn real traﬃﬃﬃc load distribution according to multiple features such as the real time current traﬃﬃﬃc load, the call
    maximum bit rate and the accepted admitted bandwidth since last epoch time, which are used in old MBTAC. In
    addition, features that including call holding time, call number etc. are utilised to enhance the performance of the
    proposed approach.
4. A compute vision aidded indoor mobile location
    - Collecting the UE mobility radio data via the own developed android software
    - Collecting the Camera data via the normal monitoring camera
    This Project introduces one machine leaning based UE indoor location service by combining the UE radio tracking
    information from the connected BTS and object tracking information from the cooperating camera. The UE radio
    tracking information from BTS is the radio signal information like RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, CQI, SINR and TA etc., which is
    measured from the related serving cell or neighbor cells. Diﬀﬀerent telecom generation like 4G and 5G may have
    diﬀﬀerent UE radio information, for example 5G beam related measurement. Multiple object tracking system (MOTS)
    with the cooperating cameras initial the objects tracking in real time and retrieve the multiple objects tracking
    information (OTI) with the relative map or real-world location information/coordination which is transferred from the
    camera image point coordination.

    - Cloud BTS transport/synchronization architecture work, for example MBTAC (measure based TAC) for RAP/cBTS VNF
    architecture, ICOM gateway for cloud BTS (internal communciation architecture), cBTS transport capacity/performance
    envulation work, RAP/Cloud BTS transport recommended conﬁﬁguration etc.
    - Cloud BTS VRAN 2.0 transport architecture FSY work.
2. Cloud BTS SR IOV based Virtual Ethernet Interface
    provide RAN level requirements for SR-IOV based Ethernet interface.
    This feature is to support Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) based vNIC in Cloud BTS xxx to meet requirements
    from VCP Edge (Verizon Cloud Platform name, aka Corona in earlier phase). It shall adhere to standard SRIOV function
    for ensuring interoperability based on PCI-SIG SRIOV speciﬁﬁcation
3. Cloud BTS IPv4/IPv6 based ICOM Gateway （between Radio AP and eNB cloud）
    CBTS splits the eNB into one component running in the cloud and another component, the radio access point (RAP).
    The communication within the eNB between these components is based on Nokia propritary internal protocols. The
    new deployment requires these protocols to traverse IPv4 / IPv6 based networks.
    Here comes the ICOM GW into the picture. This entity tunnels or interworks the internal protocols across IPv4 / IPv6
    based networks, allowing the cloud based components to communicate with the RAPs. The ICOM GW further supports
    beside QoS and security aspects the whole feature set TRS provides. Since for UP diﬀﬀerent internal protocols are
    utilized per RAP HW type, the ICOM GW could also be understood as a kind of protocol harmonizer.
4. Cloud BTS VCP Edge VM deployment and Dimensioning
    This project provide :
    a) capacity throughput of Cloud BTS VNF considering :
    - traﬃﬃﬃc model
    - Computational node
    - Scalability Support (Scale Up/Down not supported)
    b) support VM deployment on xxx Platform
    c) follow the same architecture split as proposed in another project.
5， BTS Auto detection and adjustment TDD
    Find way to detect BTS Timinging problem. With utilizing the SSTD measurement in LTE dual connectivity and the TA
    measurement to detect and determine the TimingOﬀﬀset between an E
    -UTRA eNB with PCell and an E-UTRA eNB with PSCell (for LTE-DC) Or utilizing the SFTD measurement in 5G and the TA
    measurement to detect and determine the TimingOﬀﬀset between:
    - an E-UTRA eNB with PCell and an NR with PSCell (for EN-DC),
    - an NR with PCell and an E-UTRA eNB with PSCell (for NE-DC),
    - an NR with PCell and an NR with PSCell (for NR-DC)
    - an E-UTRA eNB/gNB and an NR with neighbor cell.
    UE or BTS may do the TimingOﬀﬀset calculation based on the SSTD/SFTD and TA information of the pair BTSes above.
    Based on the calculated TimingOﬀﬀset from multiple BTS pairs, the Timing Alignment Error of the related BTS may be
    determined. BTS calculate the AlignOﬀﬀset which is the adjustment time shift for next step based on TimingOﬀﬀset and
    the multiple actions could be taken to correct such timing alignment error include TDD UL-DL frame structure and
    special subframe pattern reconﬁﬁguration and the BTS internal timing oﬀﬀset adjustment accordingly.
